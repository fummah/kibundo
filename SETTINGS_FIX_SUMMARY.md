# Settings Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Settings Navigation ✅
**Problem:** Clicking "Settings" in the navbar dropdown wasn't redirecting admin users to `/admin/settings`

**Root Cause:** The `GlobalNavBar.jsx` was using hardcoded role IDs (1, 2, 3, 4) instead of the actual ROLES constants. Admin role is `10`, not `1`.

**Fixed Files:**
- `frontend/src/components/layouts/GlobalNavBar.jsx`
  - Added ROLES import
  - Updated role checks in `goToSettings()` and `goToDashboard()`
  - Fixed role label display

---

### 2. User Settings Cannot Be Edited ✅
**Problem:** Users couldn't save profile changes (name, email, avatar, etc.)

**Root Causes:**
1. Backend `editUser` function wasn't accepting or saving the `avatar` field
2. User model didn't have an `avatar` field defined
3. Database table was missing the `avatar` column
4. Frontend was using `user?.avatarUrl` instead of `user?.avatar`

**Fixed Files:**
- `backend1/controllers/user.controller.js` - Added avatar field support
- `backend1/models/user.model.js` - Added avatar field to model
- `backend1/scripts/addAvatarColumn.js` - Created migration script
- `frontend/src/components/layouts/GlobalNavBar.jsx` - Fixed avatar field reference
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/settings/SettingsOverview.jsx` - Fixed double `/api/api/` URLs
- `frontend/vite.config.js` - Fixed backend proxy to use correct port (8080)

---

### 3. API 404 Errors (Double /api/api/) ✅
**Problem:** Getting `PUT http://localhost:5173/api/api/users/2 404 (Not Found)`

**Root Causes:**
1. `SettingsOverview.jsx` was using `/api/users/...` and `/api/upload` URLs
2. But axios already has `baseURL: "/api"` configured
3. This resulted in double `/api/api/` in the final URL
4. Vite proxy was configured for port 3001, but backend runs on 8080

**Fixed:**
- Removed `/api/` prefix from all URLs in `SettingsOverview.jsx`
- Updated Vite config to proxy to correct backend port (8080)

---

### 4. Profile Picture Cropping & Independent Save ✅
**Requirements:**
1. Users should be able to crop profile pictures to fit the needed size
2. Save settings must work even if profile picture is not uploaded

**Implementation:**
- Created `ImageCropModal` component with canvas-based cropping
- Users can zoom and drag to position their image
- Crop area shows as a circle overlay for profile pictures
- Output is a 300x300px JPEG at 90% quality
- Save settings button is completely independent of profile picture upload
- Profile picture upload has its own loading state

**Features:**
- ✅ Drag to reposition image
- ✅ Zoom slider (0.5x to 3x)
- ✅ Circular crop preview for profile pictures
- ✅ Real-time canvas rendering
- ✅ High-quality output (300x300px JPEG)

## Actions Required

### 1. Run the Database Migration

You need to add the `avatar` column to your database. Run this command:

```bash
cd backend1
node scripts/addAvatarColumn.js
```

This script will:
- Check if the `avatar` column already exists
- Add it if it doesn't exist
- Skip if it's already there (safe to run multiple times)

### 2. Restart the Frontend Development Server

The Vite config and API URLs have been updated. Restart your frontend:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then start it again
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Restart the Backend Server (if needed)

After running the migration, restart your backend server:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then start it again
cd backend1
npm start
```

## What Now Works

3. ✅ All users can upload profile pictures with **image cropping**
4. ✅ Save settings button works independently of profile picture upload
5. ✅ Profile pictures display correctly in the navbar
6. ✅ All UI text in English for consistency
